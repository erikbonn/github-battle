# github-battle
Project From Tyler McGinnis's React Coursework. This is an application that shows top github profiles filtered by language. You can click an account which takes you to their github profile. You can also compare and "battle" two GitHub users to see who comes out on top based on a few of their metrics and a winner is shown.
